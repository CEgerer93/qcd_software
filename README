This is a work in progress.

I have tested the avx/ directory on Edison
I have tested the parscalar/ directory on Edison

MIC directory as yet untested and probably buggy -- will work on this on Babbage/JLab/Stampede

jit directory is undergoing tests on BlueWaters
quda directory tested on BlueWaters

scalar directory untested.

Sources updated on the AM of Nov 3. We had some build fails in the nightlies. Hopefully
I don't have duff sources. Actually the ones I tested built fine on Edison

Hi Kostas, 
Here are the command line arguments you need for the non-JIT version of the code

-by 4  -bz 4   # this is the cache blocking size
                     # your Y and Z extents should be divisible by 4

-pxy 0 -pxyz 0 # Pad factors. I think if you miss these they get defaulted

-c 1               # Number of cores. in all MPI Mode it will be 1
-sy 1 -sz 1    # the dimensions of the Sy x Sz grid of hyperthreads
                    # in your case this will be 1x1

-minct 1        # Number of NUMA domains (in your case it will be 1)
       		    # If you leave these off they may be defaulted.

-poolsize N   # allocate a pool of N Gigabytes per MPI process.
                    # decimal fractions are allowed, e.g. 0.8 is OK
		           # Since you have 64 processes a poolsize of 1 may
			          # be a good place to start

as well as your regular -geom -iogeom and -i, -o and other flags

Best, 
B
