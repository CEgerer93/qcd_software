This is a work in progress.

I have tested the avx/ directory on Edison
I have tested the parscalar/ directory on Edison

MIC directory as yet untested and probably buggy -- will work on this on Babbage/JLab/Stampede

jit directory is undergoing tests on BlueWaters
quda directory tested on BlueWaters

scalar directory untested.

Sources updated on the AM of Nov 3. We had some build fails in the nightlies. Hopefully
I don't have duff sources. Actually the ones I tested built fine on Edison
